# Mapping Aging Farmer Demographic with Agricultural Productivity
## The Harvard Data Science Initiative Agri Datathon 2024
This project investigates the relationship between aging farmer demographics and agricultural productivity across regions in the contiguous United States. As the average age of farmers continues to rise, understanding its impact on farm production is crucial for ensuring future food security.

We analyzed National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) data, focusing on farmer age demographics, land use, and economic trends at both county and state levels. By adjusting economic data for inflation, we explored trends in crop sales, specifically distinguishing between "operators" (those who manage the farm) and "producers" (those who contribute directly to farm production).

Using Linear Regression, we assessed how farmer age trends correlate with agricultural output, considering various variables that may influence farm productivity. This analysis aims to identify regional patterns and predict potential challenges as the current generation of farmers nears retirement.
